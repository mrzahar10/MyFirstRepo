# Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello! My name is Achraf. I’m 21 years old and currently learning software engineering through hands-on projects. I'm passionate about technology, open-source, and continuous self-improvement.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, going to the gym, and learning new things—especially about programming and productivity. This file is part of a GitHub learning task to help me master version control.
